# Helm charts

[As a blogger](https://akomljen.com) and DevOps consultant I work with Helm and Kubernetes, in general, a lot.
This is my collection of Helm charts that I'm using to do some daily work, or just for research.

To start, add the repo first:
```
helm repo add akomljen-charts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komljen/helm-charts/master/charts/
```

## Official Charts Repository

Why not use official charts repo?

Well, if you tried to contribute to the official charts repo you probably know that you need to wait a few weeks or more to merge. There are a lot of opened pull requests and they require the huge amount of work. A lot of people are learning Helm while contributing, so maintainers need to guide them. That is slow and sometimes I cannot wait for changes to get merged.

From time to time, I will sync those charts to official charts repo to make them available at [KubeApps](https://kubeapps.com/).
